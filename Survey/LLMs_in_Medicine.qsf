The patient's age, sex, and lack of medical history or medication use also support this diagnosis.\n<br><br><br><b>Correct answer:<\/b>\nThe correct answer for this vignette is ankylosing spondylitis.","DataExportTag":"Q72","QuestionID":"QID72"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_3mBKqx1IU2fTaOG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID557","SecondaryAttribute":"AI advice: here is the explanation","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>AI advice:<\/strong><br \/>\nhere is the explanation<\/span>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q556","QuestionID":"QID557","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"AI advice: here is the explanation","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_3mBKqx1IU2fTaOG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID89","SecondaryAttribute":"AI advice: List of Possible Diseases Appendicitis Gastroenteritis Intussusception Mesenteric lymp...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><b>AI advice:<\/b><\/span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">List of Possible Diseases<\/span><\/h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Appendicitis<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Gastroenteritis<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Intussusception<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Mesenteric lymphadenitis<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Constipation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Narrowing Down the List<\/span><\/h3>\n\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Gastroenteritis<\/span><\/h4>\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Reason for exclusion<\/strong>: Gastroenteritis typically presents with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever, which are not mentioned in this case.

upward-pointing vertical lines. These triangular shapes culminate in a series of steps, creating a sense of upward movement and dynamism.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Bold Use of Contrasting Colors:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tArt Deco embraces bright, opulent colors. Stark contrasts, such as black and white or gold and silver, create a striking visual impact.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Modern and Traditional Materials:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tArt Deco buildings seamlessly blend stucco, terra-cotta, decorative glass, chrome, steel, and aluminum. These materials contribute to the sleek yet opulent appearance of structures.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Organic Lines:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tArt Nouveau draws inspiration from the natural world, employing sinuous, sculptural, and organic shapes. The undulating asymmetry of these lines creates a sense of movement and vitality.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Architectural Forms:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tThe style embraces arches and curving lines. Architects aimed to create something fresh and vital, resulting in buildings with unique and expressive forms.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Materials and Modernity:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tArt Nouveau architects experimented with modern materials, including iron, glass, ceramics, and later concrete. The movement rejected rigid historical conventions in favor of innovation.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Symmetry and Balance:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tGeorgian buildings are meticulously symmetrical. Their facades exhibit a harmonious arrangement of windows, doors, and other architectural features.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Distinctive Doorways:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tHistoric Georgian homes feature doors with fanlights above. Additionally, the doors are set back at least four inches from the brick face.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Durable Materials:<br \/>\n\t\t\t\tGeorgian buildings favor time-tested materials.

The hepatic lesions are characteristic of hepatic hemangiomas, which can be multiple and diffuse.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Symptoms Correlation: The combination of lethargy, tachypnea, hepatomegaly, and elevated TSH levels aligns with the clinical picture of infantile hepatic hemangioma complicated by hypothyroidism and potential high-output cardiac failure leading to cardiomegaly.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Pathophysiology: Hepatic hemangiomas in infants can secrete high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to increased cardiac output and thyroid hormone consumption.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">In conclusion, the combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, elevated TSH, and characteristic imaging findings strongly support the diagnosis of congenital infantile hepatic hemangioma with associated hypothyroidism.<\/span><\/h3>\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\n\n<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Task $e{ e:\/\/Field\/qnumber}\/20 \u00a0 Patient Information: A 16-day-old girl was brought to the emerge...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"Graphics":"IM_eWeNm1pTWD5j7Tw","GraphicsDescription":"Case3 intestinal lipomatosis","QuestionJS":"Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function()\n{\n\t\/*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*\/\n\n});\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function()\n{\n\t\/*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*\/\n\n});\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function()\n{\n\t\/*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*\/\n\n});\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnPageSubmit(function(type)\n{\nif(type == \"next\")\n{ var qnumber =\"$e{ e:\/\/Field\/qnumber + 1 }\";\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"qnumber\", qnumber);\n}\n});","QuestionText_Unsafe":"<h1>Task $e{ e:\/\/Field\/qnumber}\/10<\/h1>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Patient Information:<\/strong><\/span>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"width: 599px; height: 417px;\" src=\"https:\/\/lmubwl.eu.qualtrics.com\/CP\/Graphic.php?IM=IM_cSxM6wjVI9g3r70\"><\/div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">A 16-day-old girl was brought to the emergency department with lethargy.
