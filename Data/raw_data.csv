List of possible diseases


	Intussusception
	Mesenteric Adenitis
	Acute Gastroenteritis
	Appendicitis
	Constipation



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Intussusception:

	Best fit: The CT images show a ""target"" or ""sausage-shaped"" mass, which is characteristic of intussusception. The patient's intermittent abdominal pain is a common symptom of intussusception.
	Mesenteric Adenitis:

	The CT images do not show significant lymphadenopathy, which is typically seen in mesenteric adenitis. Additionally, mesenteric adenitis often follows a viral infection, which is not mentioned in this case.
	Acute Gastroenteritis:

	Acute gastroenteritis usually presents with vomiting and diarrhea, which are not described in this patient. The CT images also do not show signs consistent with gastroenteritis, such as diffuse bowel wall thickening.
	Appendicitis:

	The CT images do not show an inflamed appendix or periappendiceal fat stranding, which are typical signs of appendicitis. Additionally, the pain in appendicitis usually localizes to the right lower quadrant, which is not the case here.
	Constipation:

	Least likely: While constipation can cause abdominal pain, the CT images do not show significant fecal loading or dilated bowel loops indicative of constipation. The clinical presentation of intermittent pain is also not typical for simple constipation.

List of possible diseases


	Manganese Toxicity
	Parkinson's Disease
	Wilson's Disease
	Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)
	Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Manganese Toxicity:

	Best fit: The patient's history of welding without protective equipment and the MRI finding of hyperintense basal ganglia are consistent with manganese toxicity. The clinical symptoms of reduced facial expression and dysarthric speech also align well with this condition.
	Parkinson's Disease:

	While the symptoms of reduced facial expression and impaired postural reflexes are seen in Parkinson's disease, the MRI finding of a hyperintense signal in the basal ganglia is not typical. Parkinson's disease usually shows normal or hypointense signals in the basal ganglia.
	Wilson's Disease:

	The patient's normal ceruloplasmin and iron levels make Wilson's disease less likely. Additionally, Wilson's disease typically presents with hepatic dysfunction and Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are not mentioned here.
	Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP):

	PSP often presents with vertical gaze palsy, which is not described in this patient. The MRI findings are also not characteristic of PSP, which typically shows midbrain atrophy (""hummingbird sign"").
	Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):

	Least likely: MSA often presents with autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs, which are not described in this patient. The MRI findings of a hyperintense basal ganglia signal are not typical for MSA, which usually shows changes in the cerebellum and brainstem.

During this period, epigastric pain and postprandial vomiting had also developed. His BMI was 11. On examination, he was cachectic with abdominal distention and diffuse tenderness to palpation. On the basis of chest imaging and sputum studies, a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made, and intravenous antituberculous treatment was initiated. However, he continued to have postprandial vomiting. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen was obtained.

List of possible diseases


	Abdominal Tuberculosis
	Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome
	Gastric Outlet Obstruction
	Malignancy (e.g., Gastric Cancer)
	Chronic Pancreatitis



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Abdominal Tuberculosis:

	Best fit: Given the patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis and the CT findings of abdominal lymphadenopathy and possible bowel involvement, abdominal tuberculosis is highly likely. The systemic symptoms (cough, night sweats, weight loss) and the endemic region (Somalia) support this diagnosis.
	Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome:

	While the patient's symptoms of postprandial vomiting and significant weight loss could suggest SMA syndrome, the CT does not show the characteristic compression of the third portion of the duodenum between the SMA and aorta. The presence of systemic symptoms (night sweats, cough) also makes SMA syndrome less likely.
	Gastric Outlet Obstruction:

	The CT findings do not show a clear obstructive lesion at the gastric outlet or duodenum. The systemic symptoms and history of tuberculosis make a primary gastric outlet obstruction less likely as the sole diagnosis.
	Malignancy (e.g., Gastric Cancer):

	The patient's age makes a malignancy like gastric cancer less likely, although not impossible. The CT does not show a mass typical of gastric cancer, and the systemic symptoms are more consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process.
	Chronic Pancreatitis:

	Least likely: While chronic pancreatitis can cause abdominal pain and vomiting, it is less likely given the patient's young age and lack of history of alcohol use or other risk factors. The CT findings do not show the characteristic calcifications or pancreatic duct changes seen in chronic pancreatitis.

	Cyclosporine Neurotoxicity
	Hypertensive Encephalopathy
	Central Nervous System Infection
	Metabolic Encephalopathy



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):

	Best fit: The MRI shows hyperintense areas in the parieto-occipital regions, which are characteristic of PRES. The patient's symptoms of confusion, seizures, and blurry vision, along with hypertension and recent cyclosporine use, align well with this diagnosis.
	Cyclosporine Neurotoxicity:

	While cyclosporine can cause neurotoxicity, the MRI findings are more consistent with PRES. Cyclosporine neurotoxicity often presents with similar symptoms but lacks the typical MRI findings of PRES.
	Hypertensive Encephalopathy:

	The patient's blood pressure is elevated but not extremely high. The MRI findings of parieto-occipital hyperintensities are more suggestive of PRES than hypertensive encephalopathy, which can present with similar symptoms but more diffuse cerebral edema.
	
	Central Nervous System Infection:

	The normal fundoscopic examination and lack of fever or other infectious signs make a CNS infection less likely. The MRI findings do not show typical signs of infection such as meningitis or abscess.
	
	Metabolic Encephalopathy:

	Least likely: While metabolic encephalopathy can cause confusion and seizures, the MRI findings are not typical for this condition. Metabolic encephalopathy usually presents with more diffuse brain involvement rather than the localized parieto-occipital changes seen here.

	Hemorrhagic Cyst of the Ovary



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS):

	Best fit: EPS is a known complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis and can present with bloody dialysate. The CT findings of peritoneal thickening and calcification are suggestive of EPS.
	Peritoneal Dialysis-Associated Peritonitis:

	While peritonitis is a common complication, the absence of signs of infection on physical examination and unremarkable laboratory studies make it less likely. Additionally, the CT findings are more indicative of a chronic process like EPS.
	
	Peritoneal Carcinomatosis:

	Peritoneal carcinomatosis can cause bloody ascites, but the patient's history and CT findings are more consistent with EPS. The lack of other systemic symptoms or signs of malignancy makes this diagnosis less likely.
	
	Mesenteric Ischemia:

	Mesenteric ischemia typically presents with severe abdominal pain and systemic symptoms, which are not described in this patient. The CT does not show the characteristic findings of bowel wall thickening or pneumatosis intestinalis.
	Hemorrhagic Cyst of the Ovary:

	Least likely: A hemorrhagic ovarian cyst can cause abdominal pain and bleeding, but it is less likely to cause bloody dialysate. The CT findings do not show an ovarian cyst or any related pathology.

	Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
	Neurosyphilis
	Spinal Cord Tumor
	HIV-Associated Myelopathy



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD):

	Best fit: The patient's low vitamin B12 level and the MRI findings of dorsal column hyperintensities are characteristic of SCD. The clinical presentation of sensory ataxia, impaired proprioception, and preserved nociception further supports this diagnosis.
	Multiple Sclerosis (MS):

	MS can cause similar MRI findings, but it typically presents with multiple lesions scattered throughout the CNS, not confined to the dorsal columns. The patient's symptoms and history of low vitamin B12 make SCD more likely than MS.
	Neurosyphilis:

	Neurosyphilis can present with sensory ataxia and dorsal column involvement, but it usually occurs in individuals with a history of syphilis, which is not mentioned here. Additionally, the low vitamin B12 level and MRI findings are more consistent with SCD.
	Spinal Cord Tumor:

	A spinal cord tumor can cause similar symptoms, but the MRI would typically show a mass effect rather than diffuse dorsal column hyperintensity. The patient's low vitamin B12 level and the specific MRI findings make SCD a more likely diagnosis.
	HIV-Associated Myelopathy:

	Least likely: HIV-associated myelopathy can cause dorsal column involvement, but it usually presents in individuals with known HIV infection and other systemic symptoms. The patient's low vitamin B12 level and the specific MRI findings are more consistent with SCD.

List of possible diseases


	Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm Rupture
	Pulmonary Embolism
	Aortic Dissection
	Myocardial Infarction
	Pneumothorax



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm Rupture:

	Best fit: The CT shows an enlarged pulmonary artery with signs of potential rupture, which aligns with the patient's history of a pulmonary aneurysm and presentation with chest pain. This diagnosis is the most likely given the patient's known condition and the imaging findings.
	Pulmonary Embolism:

	While pulmonary embolism can present with chest pain and the patient has pulmonary arterial hypertension, the CT does not show the characteristic filling defects within the pulmonary arteries. The clinical presentation and patient's history make a pulmonary artery aneurysm rupture more likely.
	Aortic Dissection:

	Aortic dissection can cause severe chest pain and would show a widened mediastinum or a double lumen in the aorta on CT. The CT findings do not indicate an aortic dissection, and the patient's history of a pulmonary aneurysm makes this less likely.
	Myocardial Infarction:

	Myocardial infarction could present with chest pain but is usually diagnosed with ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes, not primarily with CT imaging. The patient's history and CT findings suggest a pulmonary cause rather than a cardiac one.
	Pneumothorax:

	Least likely: Pneumothorax would present with chest pain and shortness of breath and show a collapsed lung on CT, which is not observed here. The patient's history and the specific CT findings make pneumothorax an unlikely diagnosis.

List of possible diseases


	Rhinolith
	Osteoma
	Inverted Papilloma
	Foreign Body
	Nasal Polyp with Calcification



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Rhinolith:

	Best fit: Rhinoliths are calcified masses within the nasal cavity and can present with chronic nasal obstruction and a hard, nontender mass. The radiodense mass observed on CT is characteristic of a rhinolith.
	Osteoma:

	Osteomas are benign bone tumors that can occur in the sinuses but are more typically found in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. While they can present as hard, radiodense masses, the clinical presentation of a calcified mass in the nasal cavity is more consistent with a rhinolith.
	Inverted Papilloma:

	Inverted papillomas are benign tumors that can cause nasal obstruction but typically present as soft tissue masses rather than calcified masses. The hard, white mass and radiodense appearance on CT make this less likely.
	Foreign Body:

	A foreign body can cause chronic nasal obstruction and might appear as a radiodense mass if calcified. However, the absence of a history of foreign body insertion and the typical appearance on rhinoscopy and CT make a rhinolith more likely.
	Nasal Polyp with Calcification:

	Least likely: Nasal polyps are soft, non-calcified masses that can cause obstruction but are not typically hard and radiodense. The CT findings and clinical presentation are more indicative of a rhinolith.

	Neonatal Hemochromatosis
	Congenital Heart Disease
	TORCH Infection (e.g., Cytomegalovirus)



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Infantile Hepatic Hemangioendothelioma (IHHE):

	Best fit: IHHE often presents with hepatomegaly, multiple hepatic lesions, and can cause cardiomegaly due to high-output cardiac failure. The presence of small hemangiomas on the skin and the characteristic MRI findings strongly support this diagnosis.
	Congenital Hypothyroidism:

	While congenital hypothyroidism can present with elevated TSH and lethargy, it does not typically cause multiple hepatic lesions or hemangiomas. The MRI findings of numerous hepatic lesions and cardiomegaly are more consistent with IHHE.
	Neonatal Hemochromatosis:

	Neonatal hemochromatosis can cause hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction, but it usually presents with iron overload and does not typically present with multiple hepatic lesions or skin hemangiomas. The imaging findings and clinical features are more suggestive of IHHE.
	Congenital Heart Disease:

	Congenital heart disease can cause cardiomegaly and tachypnea, but it does not explain the hepatomegaly, multiple hepatic lesions, or skin hemangiomas. The MRI findings and clinical presentation are more consistent with a vascular tumor like IHHE.
	TORCH Infection (e.g., Cytomegalovirus):

	Least likely: TORCH infections can cause hepatomegaly and neurological symptoms, but they typically present with a different pattern of liver involvement and do not usually cause multiple hepatic lesions or hemangiomas. The MRI findings and clinical presentation are more consistent with IHHE.

Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Cerebral Metastases:

	Best fit: Given the patient's history of colon adenocarcinoma with known metastatic lesions and the MRI showing multiple enhancing lesions, cerebral metastases are highly likely. The altered mental status aligns with potential brain involvement by metastatic disease.
	Primary CNS Lymphoma:

	Primary CNS lymphoma can present with multiple enhancing brain lesions, but it is less common in patients without a history of immunosuppression. The patient's known metastatic colon cancer makes cerebral metastases more likely.
	Brain Abscesses:

	Brain abscesses can present with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, but they are usually associated with infectious symptoms such as fever or a known source of infection. The patient's history of metastatic cancer makes cerebral metastases more likely.
	Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):

	PML typically presents with non-enhancing white matter lesions and is associated with immunosuppressed states. The enhancing lesions on MRI and the patient's cancer history suggest cerebral metastases rather than PML.
	Glioblastoma Multiforme:

	Least likely: Glioblastoma usually presents as a solitary, irregularly enhancing mass rather than multiple lesions. The patient's known metastatic disease and the MRI findings make cerebral metastases the most likely diagnosis.

Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	AIDS-related Lymphoma:

	Best fit: AIDS-related lymphoma often presents with systemic symptoms like night sweats, severe splenomegaly, and abdominal pain. The patient's extremely low CD4 count and the presence of splenic infarction are consistent with this diagnosis.
	Disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) Infection:

	Disseminated MAC infection can cause splenomegaly and systemic symptoms in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS. However, it typically presents with a more diffuse pattern of organ involvement and lymphadenopathy rather than focal splenic infarction.
	Splenic Abscess:

	Splenic abscess can cause splenomegaly and abdominal pain, but it usually presents with fever and localized signs of infection. The CT findings of multifocal infarction are less typical for a splenic abscess.
	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection:

	CMV infection can cause systemic symptoms and splenomegaly in immunocompromised patients, but it typically involves multiple organs and causes diffuse splenic involvement rather than focal infarction. The imaging findings are more consistent with lymphoma.
	Leishmaniasis:

	Least likely: Leishmaniasis can cause splenomegaly and systemic symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals. However, it typically presents with diffuse splenic enlargement rather than focal infarction, and it is less common in this clinical context.

	Sarcoidosis



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis):

	Best fit: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can present with upper and lower respiratory symptoms, including nasal crusting and bone destruction. The CT findings of extensive midface bone destruction are characteristic of this vasculitis.
	Invasive Fungal Sinusitis:

	Invasive fungal sinusitis can cause bone destruction and severe sinusitis, especially in immunocompromised patients. However, the chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of systemic symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath make granulomatosis with polyangiitis more likely.
	Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type:

	This lymphoma can present with destructive nasal lesions and systemic symptoms, but it is less common and often associated with more aggressive and rapid progression. The imaging findings and the chronicity of symptoms are more consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
	Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis:

	Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis can cause nasal symptoms and sinusitis but typically does not cause extensive bone destruction. The CT findings and the presence of systemic symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.
	Sarcoidosis:

	Least likely: Sarcoidosis can affect the respiratory tract and cause systemic symptoms, but it typically does not cause the extensive bone destruction seen in this case. The imaging findings are more suggestive of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

	Infectious colitis
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
	Colonic neoplasm



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Diverticulitis:

	Best Fit: The left lower quadrant pain and elevated white-cell count are consistent with diverticulitis. The CT findings of edema and thumbprinting in the sigmoid colon support this diagnosis, as it is often associated with inflammation and thickening of the colon wall in diverticulitis.
	Ischemic colitis:

	Ischemic colitis can present with abdominal pain and thumbprinting on CT, indicating mucosal edema and submucosal hemorrhage. However, the absence of more severe symptoms like bloody diarrhea and a normal lactate level make significant ischemia less likely.
	Infectious colitis:

	Infectious colitis can present with abdominal pain and elevated white-cell count. However, it often involves more diffuse colonic involvement rather than being localized to the sigmoid colon, and the imaging findings are less suggestive of an infectious cause.
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):

	IBD, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, could present with abdominal pain and elevated white-cell count. However, the acute presentation and specific imaging findings are more characteristic of diverticulitis rather than a chronic inflammatory process.
	Colonic neoplasm:

	Least Likely: A colonic neoplasm could present with abdominal pain and elevated white-cell count if there is associated inflammation or obstruction. However, the acute onset of symptoms and imaging findings of edema and thumbprinting are less typical for a neoplasm and more suggestive of an inflammatory or ischemic process.

	Multiple sclerosis (MS)
	Central nervous system (CNS) infection
	Brain tumor



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Wernicke's encephalopathy:

	Best Fit: The patient's symptoms of vertigo, confusion, nystagmus, and gait ataxia, combined with the history of recent surgical abortion, suggest a possibility of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which can be precipitated by malnutrition or hyperemesis. The MRI image showing hyperintensity in the periaqueductal area is characteristic of this condition.
	Cerebellar stroke:

	A cerebellar stroke can cause vertigo, nystagmus, and gait ataxia. However, the MRI image does not show the acute changes typically associated with a stroke, such as restricted diffusion or hemorrhage, and the patient's history is less suggestive of a vascular event.
	Multiple sclerosis (MS):

	MS can present with a wide range of neurological symptoms, including vertigo, nystagmus, and ataxia. However, the MRI findings are not typical of demyelinating lesions usually seen in MS, and the acute onset of symptoms following surgery is less consistent with MS.
	Central nervous system (CNS) infection:

	A CNS infection could present with confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus. However, the MRI does not show the typical signs of infection, such as meningeal enhancement or abscess formation, and there are no accompanying systemic signs of infection in the history provided.
	Brain tumor: Least likely:

	A brain tumor could cause vertigo, nystagmus, and ataxia. However, the MRI does not show a mass lesion or the typical features of a tumor, and the rapid onset of symptoms following surgery is less typical for a brain tumor, which usually presents with a more gradual progression.

	Metastatic melanoma:

	Best Fit: The MRI shows multiple lesions, which is characteristic of metastatic disease. Additionally, the presence of bluish nodular skin lesions aligns with cutaneous manifestations of melanoma.
	Kaposi sarcoma:

	Kaposi sarcoma can present with bluish nodular skin lesions and metastasize to the brain. However, it is more common in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS), and there is no mention of such a condition in the patient's history.
	Meningioma:

	Meningiomas can present with headaches due to increased intracranial pressure. However, they typically present as a single lesion rather than multiple lesions, and there is no direct correlation with bluish nodular skin lesions.
	Glioblastoma multiforme:

	Glioblastoma can present with progressively worsening headaches and multiple brain lesions. However, glioblastomas are usually solitary and rapidly enlarging, with less emphasis on cutaneous manifestations.
	Cerebral abscess:

Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):

	Best Fit: LAM is associated with cystic lung disease and can present with spontaneous pneumothorax, especially in women. The CT scan shows diffuse intraparenchymal pulmonary cysts, which is characteristic of LAM.
	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):

	COPD can cause dyspnea and pneumothorax, but it typically presents with emphysematous changes rather than diffuse cysts. The CT findings of diffuse intraparenchymal cysts are not typical of COPD.
	Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH):

	PLCH can present with cystic lung disease and pneumothorax. However, it is more common in smokers, and the cysts are often irregular and nodular, which is less consistent with the presented image.
	Bullous emphysema:

	Bullous emphysema can lead to pneumothorax and progressive dyspnea. However, it usually presents with large bullae rather than the diffuse, small cystic changes seen on the CT scan.
	Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP):

	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD):

	Best Fit: CJD typically presents with rapidly progressive cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia. The MRI finding of hyperintensity in the cortical gyri and caudate heads is characteristic of CJD.
	Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE):

	HSE can cause cognitive deterioration and neurologic signs such as hyperreflexia and ataxia. However, it more commonly affects the temporal lobes and is associated with fever and altered consciousness, which are not mentioned here.
	Wernicke encephalopathy:

	Wernicke encephalopathy can present with disorientation, ataxia, and nystagmus. However, it is typically associated with a history of alcoholism or malnutrition, and the MRI findings are more characteristic of CJD than Wernicke encephalopathy.
	Autoimmune encephalitis:

	Autoimmune encephalitis can cause cognitive decline, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. However, the rapid progression of symptoms and the specific MRI findings are more suggestive of CJD.

Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis):

	Best Fit: The patient's history of living in a rural area with contact with dogs, along with the imaging showing a large cyst in the liver, strongly suggests hydatid disease. The presence of a cyst with internal septations is characteristic of Echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus.
	Hepatic cystadenoma:

	Hepatic cystadenomas can present with large cysts in the liver and may cause discomfort due to their size. However, they are usually not associated with a history of exposure to dogs or rural living, making this less likely.
	Pyogenic liver abscess:

	A pyogenic liver abscess can present with a hepatic mass and discomfort, but it is typically associated with systemic signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white-cell count, which are not present in this case.
	Hepatic hemangioma:

	Hepatic hemangiomas are common liver lesions that can be large and cause discomfort. However, they usually appear as well-circumscribed, hypervascular lesions on imaging, which does not match the cystic appearance seen in the provided image.
	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):

	Least Likely: HCC can present with a hepatic mass and hepatomegaly, but it is more commonly associated with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The imaging findings of a large cyst with septations are not typical of HCC.

List of possible diseases


	Metastatic carcinoma
	Orbital lymphoma
	Orbital pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Disease)
	Orbital sarcoma
	Sarcoidosis



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Metastatic carcinoma:

	Best Fit: Metastatic carcinoma is most likely given the presence of numerous hepatic masses, abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease which are common sites for metastases. The mass in the orbit could also be a metastasis.
	Orbital lymphoma:

	Orbital lymphoma is possible given the orbital mass; however, it is less likely because it typically would not present with extensive systemic metastases like the hepatic and vertebral involvement seen here.
	Orbital pseudotumor:

	Orbital pseudotumor usually presents with inflammation and pain in the eye, but it does not explain the hepatic masses, lymphadenopathy, and vertebral disease, making it less likely.
	Orbital sarcoma:

	While orbital sarcoma can present with a mass in the orbit, it is less common and less likely to present with such widespread systemic disease (hepatic masses and vertebral involvement) compared to metastatic carcinoma.
	Sarcoidosis:

	Least Likely: Sarcoidosis can present with lymphadenopathy and orbital involvement, but the presence of numerous hepatic masses and the pattern of bone involvement are atypical, making it the least likely diagnosis.

List of possible diseases


	Neurocysticercosis
	Toxoplasmosis
	Tuberculosis
	Metastatic disease
	Sarcoidosis



Detailed assessment of each possible diagnosis


	Neurocysticercosis:

	Best Fit: Neurocysticercosis is the most likely diagnosis given the MRI findings of numerous well-defined cystic lesions throughout the cerebral cortex, which are characteristic of this parasitic infection. The patient's seizure and confusion are also consistent with neurocysticercosis.
	Toxoplasmosis:

	Toxoplasmosis can present with multiple brain lesions and seizures, but it typically affects immunocompromised individuals and the lesions are often more varied in appearance, making it a less likely fit for this patient.
	Tuberculosis:

	Tuberculosis can cause central nervous system involvement, but it usually presents with tuberculomas or meningitis rather than numerous cystic lesions, making it less likely in this case.
	Metastatic disease:

	Metastatic disease can present with multiple brain lesions, but the patient's young age and the presence of well-defined cystic lesions without a known primary malignancy make this diagnosis less likely.
	Sarcoidosis:

	Least Likely: Sarcoidosis can involve the central nervous system but typically presents with granulomatous inflammation and is less likely to cause numerous well-defined cystic lesions as seen in the MRI. Additionally, it would usually be associated with other systemic symptoms or findings.

Patient Information: 



A previously healthy 5-year-old boy was brought to the surgery clinic with a 2-day history of intermittent abdominal pain. On palpation of the abdomen there was pain in the periumbilical region, but no rebound or guarding. An ultrasound was normal, and a computed tomography of the abdomen was performed (Panels A,B).
 

 
 AI advice:   

The patient is likely suffering from intussusception. This diagnosis is based on several key findings:


	Clinical Presentation: A previously healthy 5-year-old boy presented with a 2-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, a classic symptom of intussusception.
	Physical Examination: Pain was noted in the periumbilical region on palpation, but there was no rebound or guarding, which can be consistent with intussusception in its early stages.
	Imaging Findings: While the initial ultrasound was normal, the computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen shows a characteristic “target” or “sausage-shaped” mass, indicative of intussusception, where a segment of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment.
	Symptoms Correlation: Intermittent abdominal pain, especially in young children, is highly suggestive of intussusception, which often presents with episodic pain as the telescoping segment moves and obstructs the bowel intermittently.
	Pathophysiology: Intussusception occurs when a part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestine (telescoping), leading to bowel obstruction, ischemia, and pain.
	Risk Factors: Although the specific risk factors in this child are not detailed, intussusception can occur in otherwise healthy children and is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in this age group.


In conclusion, the combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, and characteristic imaging strongly support the diagnosis of intussusception.

Key Features Supporting the Diagnosis: Endemic Area: The patient lives in a rural area of Morocco, which is an endemic region for echinococcosis (hydatid disease). Echinococcosis is common in regions where livestock farming and contact with infected dogs occur. Infected dogs shed the Echinococcus eggs in their feces, which are ingested by intermediate hosts such as sheep, goats, or cattle. Humans are accidental hosts, typically through ingestion of eggs from contaminated water, food, or direct contact with infected animals.  Right Upper Quadrant Discomfort: The patient’s symptoms of intermittent discomfort in the right upper quadrant are consistent with liver involvement in hydatid disease. The liver is the most common site of cyst formation.  Hepatomegaly and Palpable Hepatic Mass: Hepatomegaly with a palpable mass is common in liver echinococcosis due to the presence of the hydatid cyst in the liver. The cyst can grow large and cause symptoms due to its size, pressure effects, or secondary infection.  Imaging Findings:  Ultrasonography and CT scans showing a large cyst in the right lobe of the liver are highly suggestive of hydatid cyst formation. Hydatid cysts appear as well-defined, hypoechoic masses on ultrasound and can have characteristic daughter cysts or a multilocular appearance on CT. The cysts are typically non-communicating with the bile ducts, and the wall of the cyst may calcify over time. Normal White Cell Count and Eosinophils: In echinococcosis, the white-cell count and eosinophil count may be normal in early stages of the disease. Elevated eosinophils are more common in acute or secondary infections (e.g., cyst rupture or bacterial superinfection), but may not always be seen in chronic cases.  Diagnosis: Hydatid Disease (Echinococcosis) Hydatid disease is caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus tapeworm, most commonly Echinococcus granulosus, and it primarily affects the liver and lungs. The cysts are formed as a result of the parasitic larvae developing within organs after ingestion of Echinococcus eggs.  Pathophysiology: Humans become infected by ingesting Echinococcus eggs, which are excreted in the feces of infected dogs. The eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing oncospheres that penetrate the intestinal wall and travel via the bloodstream to organs such as the liver, lungs, and rarely the brain. Once in the liver or lungs, the oncospheres develop into hydatid cysts, which can grow slowly over months or years, leading to liver enlargement and mass formation. The cysts may contain daughter cysts or hydatid sand (small particles of scoleces and protoscolices). Clinical Features: Abdominal Pain: The patient may experience intermittent discomfort or pain in the right upper quadrant due to pressure from the growing cyst, biliary obstruction, or inflammation. Hepatomegaly: Enlargement of the liver due to the growing cyst is common. Palpable Mass: A palpable hepatic mass can often be felt on physical examination if the cyst is large. Jaundice: In some cases, biliary obstruction by the cyst can lead to jaundice. Anaphylactic Reactions: If a cyst ruptures, it can lead to anaphylaxis due to the release of antigenic material from the cyst. This is a medical emergency. Diagnosis: Ultrasound: Ultrasonography is a common initial imaging modality for detecting hydatid cysts in the liver. Hydatid cysts often have a characteristic hypoechoic appearance. The WHO classification system for hydatid cysts on ultrasound is based on the presence of cysts, their internal content, and the wall characteristics. CT Scan: CT imaging can help identify larger cysts and assess for complications such as cyst rupture, superinfection, or calcification. Serologic Testing: Serologic tests (e.g., ELISA, indirect hemagglutination test) can be used to detect Echinococcus antigens in the blood, although these tests may not always be positive in early or localized disease. PCR: PCR-based assays may be used to confirm the diagnosis in difficult cases. Differential Diagnosis: Liver Abscess: A bacterial liver abscess can also present with a hepatic mass and right upper quadrant pain, but it would typically be associated with fever and elevated white cell count, and the imaging would not show the classic features of a hydatid cyst. Hepatic Neoplasms: Liver tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastases, can present as a hepatic mass, but these usually lack the characteristic cystic appearance and are associated with other clinical signs, such as elevated liver function tests or tumor markers. Schistosomiasis: In schistosomiasis, liver involvement can lead to hepatomegaly and fibrosis, but the cystic formation is not typical, and the patient would have a history of exposure to contaminated water. Biliary Cystadenoma: Biliary cystadenomas can cause cystic liver masses but are typically solitary, lack the daughter cysts characteristic of hydatid cysts, and have different imaging features. Management: Surgical Treatment: The treatment of choice for hydatid cysts is surgical resection. The cyst may be removed surgically or aspirated percutaneously (if the cyst is uncomplicated and in a favorable location). In high-risk or complicated cases, laparoscopic surgery may be considered. Albendazole or Mebendazole: These antiparasitic medications can be used in conjunction with surgery or for cases where surgery is not feasible. They help sterilize the cyst and prevent secondary infection or recurrence. Percutaneous Aspiration: In some cases, the cyst may be aspirated under imaging guidance, and the contents are drained. This may be combined with the use of scolicidal agents. Vaccination: There is no human vaccine for echinococcosis, but vaccination of dogs in endemic regions can help reduce transmission. Prognosis: The prognosis of hydatid disease depends on the size and location of the cysts, as well as the presence of complications such as cyst rupture or infection. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is generally favorable, though recurrence is possible, especially in cases where the cyst was incompletely treated. Conclusion: This patient most likely has hydatid disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus, which is endemic in rural regions like Morocco. The patient’s symptoms, clinical findings, and imaging studies are consistent with a hydatid cyst in the liver. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment (surgical resection and/or antiparasitic therapy) are essential for preventing complications and improving the prognosis.",4.56,48.88,51.564,4,"The most likely diagnosis for this 59-year-old woman with right eye inflammation and pain, a right orbital mass, blindness in the eye, and widespread metastatic disease (hepatic masses, abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease) is orbital metastasis from an undifferentiated carcinoma, likely breast cancer or another solid malignancy.  Key Features Supporting the Diagnosis: Orbital Mass with Pain and Inflammation: The presence of an orbital mass causing pain and inflammation in an eye that was already blind for several years suggests the possibility of orbital metastasis. Orbital metastasis is a common manifestation of systemic malignancies, particularly from breast cancer (in women) or lung cancer, which often metastasize to the orbit.  Chronic Blindness: The fact that the patient had been blind in the eye for several years before the onset of inflammation suggests that there may have been previous orbital involvement or a longstanding tumor that had caused vision loss over time, possibly before becoming symptomatic.  Extensive Metastatic Disease: The patient has numerous hepatic masses, abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease. These are signs of widespread metastatic cancer, likely originating from a primary malignancy with hematogenous or lymphatic spread to multiple organs, including the liver, bones, and lymph nodes.  Enucleation for Diagnosis and Palliative Care: The decision to enucleate the right eye for palliative relief and tissue diagnosis suggests that the orbital mass was causing significant discomfort and could not be managed conservatively. The need for histopathological examination emphasizes the likelihood of a metastatic carcinoma.  Diagnosis: Orbital Metastasis (likely from Breast Cancer) Orbital metastasis is the most common site of metastatic involvement in the eye and orbit, typically presenting as an orbital mass, often causing pain, proptosis, and sometimes vision problems (such as blindness in this case). It is a manifestation of advanced cancer and occurs through hematogenous or lymphatic spread.  Common Primary Malignancies that Metastasize to the Orbit: Breast cancer: This is the most common primary malignancy in women that metastasizes to the orbit. Breast cancer metastases can present as orbital masses, and the patient’s history of widespread metastatic disease with liver involvement and lymphadenopathy is highly suggestive of breast cancer. Lung cancer: Another common primary malignancy that can metastasize to the orbit. Prostate cancer: In men, prostate cancer is a common source of orbital metastasis. Renal cell carcinoma: This can also present with orbital metastasis, though it is less common. Pathophysiology: Orbital metastasis typically occurs due to hematogenous spread of cancer cells, with the orbit being a favored site for breast cancer, lung cancer, and others. The cancer cells invade the orbital tissues and can lead to inflammation, pain, and the formation of an orbital mass. The fact that the patient had blindness in the eye prior to presentation suggests previous orbital involvement or a chronic tumor that had slowly infiltrated the optic nerve or other structures. Clinical Features of Orbital Metastasis: Pain and inflammation: Often, the metastasis causes significant pain and swelling due to local invasion or pressure on surrounding structures. Proptosis: Bulging of the eye may occur as the tumor grows within the orbit. Vision loss: This may occur due to optic nerve compression or infiltration. Eyelid swelling and erythema may occur, especially if the tumor involves the eyelid structures. Diagnostic Workup: Imaging: The orbital mass was identified on MRI, and further CT imaging may have been performed to assess the extent of metastatic disease in the abdomen (liver), thorax (lymph nodes), and vertebrae (bone metastasis). Histopathological Examination: Enucleation of the eye was done for both palliative relief and diagnosis. The tissue would be examined under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma and determine the primary site. Mammography: If breast cancer is suspected as the primary malignancy, mammography or breast ultrasound would be important to assess for breast masses or signs of previous breast cancer. Bone Scintigraphy or PET-CT: To further evaluate the skeletal involvement, given the presence of vertebral sclerotic osseous disease, a bone scan or PET-CT would help in staging and assessing the extent of metastatic spread. Treatment: Palliative Care: The primary focus for this patient is likely palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms caused by orbital and systemic metastatic disease. This can include radiation therapy for the orbital mass, pain management, and other supportive measures. Systemic Therapy: The treatment of the primary malignancy (e.g., breast cancer) with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormonal therapy may be necessary, depending on the type of primary tumor. Surgical Interventions: In cases of orbital metastasis, surgical excision of the tumor or enucleation (as in this case) may be performed for palliative relief if the tumor causes significant pain or vision loss. Prognosis: Orbital metastasis is usually a sign of advanced systemic disease. The prognosis depends on the primary cancer, the extent of metastatic spread, and the response to systemic treatments. Generally, orbital metastasis carries a poor prognosis, particularly when accompanied by widespread liver, bone, and lymphatic metastases. Treatment may improve symptom control and provide palliative relief, but the overall survival is generally limited due to the extent of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This patient likely has orbital metastasis from an undifferentiated carcinoma, with breast cancer being a strong possibility due to the patient's gender, hepatic and lymph node metastases, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease. The orbital mass, blindness, and pain are consistent with metastatic involvement of the orbit, and enucleation was performed for both diagnostic purposes and palliative relief.",3.689,42.074,44.293,3,"The most likely diagnosis for this 18-year-old man with generalized tonic–clonic seizures, confusion, swelling over the right eye, tenderness in the right testis, and numerous well-defined cystic lesions throughout the cerebral cortex on MRI is neurocysticercosis.  Key Features Supporting the Diagnosis: Seizures: Neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of seizures in patients from endemic regions where Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) infection is common. Seizures, particularly generalized tonic-clonic seizures, are a hallmark of neurocysticercosis, which results from the cystic larval form of the tapeworm invading the central nervous system.  Swelling over the Right Eye and Testicular Tenderness: The presence of swelling over the right eye and tenderness in the right testis suggests extra-cerebral involvement, which is characteristic of Taenia solium infections. Cysticercosis can affect other tissues, including the eyes (leading to ocular cysts) and the testes (where testicular cysts can develop). The swelling and tenderness in these areas could be due to inflammatory reactions or cyst formation in those tissues.  MRI Findings: The MRI showing numerous well-defined cystic lesions throughout the cerebral cortex is highly suggestive of cysticercosis. These cysts are the result of the larval form of Taenia solium, which can form cystic lesions (cysticerci) in the brain and other tissues. The cysts may present at different stages of development, from vesicular cysts (fluid-filled) to calcified lesions, depending on the duration of the infection.  Endemic Area: Although this patient's country of origin or travel history isn't provided, neurocysticercosis is endemic in developing countries, particularly in areas where Taenia solium infection is common due to poor sanitation and the consumption of undercooked pork. The patient may have been exposed to Taenia solium eggs, either directly or through contaminated food or water.  Diagnosis: Neurocysticercosis Neurocysticercosis is the result of infection with Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm. The infection occurs when a person ingests Taenia solium eggs, typically from contaminated food or water. These eggs hatch in the intestines, releasing larvae that can invade various tissues, including the brain, eyes, and muscles. Cystic lesions form in the brain, which are often visualized as well-defined cystic lesions on MRI.  Pathophysiology: Taenia solium is transmitted through fecal-oral contamination (typically from human feces) that contains tapeworm eggs. The eggs hatch in the intestines and release oncospheres, which travel through the bloodstream to various organs. In the brain, the larvae form cysticercal cysts (cysticerci) that cause inflammation and seizures. In the eyes and muscles, cysts can also develop, leading to ocular cysts or muscular cysts. Clinical Features: Seizures: These are the most common presenting symptom, especially if brain cysts involve the cortex. Seizures may be generalized or focal depending on the location of the cysts. Confusion: Cysticercosis can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to altered mental status such as confusion or cognitive dysfunction. Cystic Masses: The cysts are often visualized on neuroimaging as well-defined cystic lesions. They may appear in different stages (vesicular, colloidal, and calcified). Extra-cerebral Involvement: Extra-cerebral cysts can occur, including ocular cysts (which can lead to vision problems) and testicular cysts (causing tenderness and swelling in the testes). Swelling over the right eye could be due to the presence of an ocular cyst, and testicular involvement could cause painful swelling in the testis. Diagnosis: MRI of the Brain: The key diagnostic feature is the presence of well-defined cystic lesions in the cerebral cortex. MRI may also show calcified lesions, which are indicative of chronic infection. The cysts may be at different stages, from active vesicular to calcified, depending on the duration of the infection. Serologic Testing: Serology (e.g., enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB)) can detect antibodies against Taenia solium in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), supporting the diagnosis. CSF Examination: If a lumbar puncture is performed, the CSF may show elevated white blood cell count (pleocytosis) and elevated protein, which is indicative of an inflammatory response to the cystic lesions. Histology: If an ocular or testicular cyst is removed, histologic examination can confirm the diagnosis by identifying cysticerci. Differential Diagnosis: Brain Tumors: Primary or metastatic brain tumors can present with seizures and focal neurological signs, but they would not show the characteristic cystic lesions seen in neurocysticercosis on MRI. Tuberculomas: Tuberculomas can cause seizures and brain masses, but they tend to have a different appearance on imaging (often ring-enhancing lesions) and are typically associated with a history of tuberculosis. Abscesses: Brain abscesses can present with similar seizures and focal neurological findings but are generally associated with fever and an acute inflammatory response, which is not seen in this patient. Abscesses would typically have a different appearance on MRI (with ring enhancement). Echinococcosis: Hydatid cysts in the brain can present with cystic lesions, but they are less likely to present with seizures in the acute setting and are more likely to present with chronic symptoms or mass effect. The cysts in echinococcosis tend to have a more defined wall compared to the vesicular stage of cysticercosis. Treatment: Antiparasitic Therapy: The treatment for neurocysticercosis typically involves antiparasitic medications such as albendazole or praziquantel, which help to kill the cysts. Albendazole is more commonly used and is often given with corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) to reduce inflammation caused by dying cysts. Seizure Management: Antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenytoin, levetiracetam) are used to control seizures. Seizures may persist as the cysts die and become calcified. Surgical Intervention: In some cases, surgical removal of cysts (especially ocular cysts) or drainage of cysts causing significant pressure effects may be required. Management of Complications: Management of complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus, may involve shunt placement or other supportive measures. Prognosis: The prognosis of neurocysticercosis depends on the number of cysts, the stage of infection, the location of the cysts, and how early the condition is treated. Seizures often improve with antiparasitic therapy and antiepileptic drugs. Chronic cysticercosis (with calcified cysts) may lead to permanent neurological deficits or epilepsy if not treated properly, but with prompt and adequate therapy, many patients experience significant improvement. Conclusion: This patient's presentation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, confusion, swelling over the right eye, testicular tenderness, and numerous cystic lesions in the brain is most consistent with neurocysticercosis, caused by infection with Taenia solium. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antiparasitic therapy, seizure management, and supportive care are critical for improving the patient's outcomes.",2.969,41.409,43.78,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,"2,3,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12",,4.077,11.042,12.33,12,25,1.203,1.203,4.001,1,7,7,5,6,4.608,21.401,22.32,4,80,,,,6,6.108,6.108,6.976,1,6,7,6,7,6,3.528,7.014,11.507,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,EAF21AD0-7F3A-40E7-BD8F-7652B0DFABBE,21,,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59382,33667,37291,35823,39679,39061,37447,39401,42601,36494,45070,39977,34899,94123,44482,53656,54047,51663,44396,43973,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Clinical Presentation: History of intermittent abdominal pain: This is a hallmark symptom of intussusception, especially in children. The pain typically occurs in episodes, correlating with the movement of the telescoping bowel. Duration of symptoms: A 2-day history of intermittent abdominal pain is consistent with early or moderate-stage intussusception, before more severe complications like bowel ischemia or perforation occur. 2. Physical Examination: Localized pain in the periumbilical region: This may suggest early bowel obstruction. In some cases, as the condition progresses, a palpable mass may be noted (a ""sausage-shaped"" mass). Absence of rebound tenderness or guarding: This is useful in differentiating early or uncomplicated intussusception from other causes of abdominal pain, such as perforation or peritonitis, where such signs would typically be present. 3. Imaging: Normal ultrasound initially: Intussusception can sometimes be difficult to detect on ultrasound in its early stages, especially if the segment of bowel involved is not well-defined or is in a location that’s difficult to visualize. CT imaging findings: The characteristic “target” or “sausage-shaped” mass seen on CT is a classic sign of intussusception. This represents the telescoping segment of the bowel, which can obstruct the passage of contents and cause ischemia. The CT scan not only confirms the diagnosis but also provides valuable information about the extent of the obstruction, potential bowel compromise, and the presence of any complications. 4. Symptoms Correlation: The episodic nature of the pain correlates well with the movement of the telescoped bowel, which intermittently obstructs the intestinal lumen, causing pain as it moves. 5. Pathophysiology: Intussusception occurs when one segment of the intestine telescopes into another, often causing obstruction, ischemia, and sometimes necrosis if not treated promptly. The pain arises as the bowel wall stretches and as peristalsis tries to move the bowel, causing intermittent obstruction. 6. Risk Factors: While this child has no specific risk factors noted, intussusception is most common in children aged 6 months to 3 years, though it can occur in older children as well. Although many cases occur without any identifiable underlying condition, intussusception in older children or adults may sometimes be associated with lead points, such as polyps or tumors, but this is not the case in this otherwise healthy child. Conclusion: The combination of intermittent abdominal pain, the absence of peritoneal signs (like rebound tenderness), and the characteristic imaging findings strongly support the diagnosis of intussusception. Prompt treatment is critical, and the child should be managed with either non-surgical reduction (e.g., air or contrast enema) or surgical intervention, depending on the severity and any complications seen on imaging or during further evaluation.  Further Management: Hydration and monitoring: Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation to prevent shock, and closely monitor for signs of bowel perforation or other complications. Treatment options: Non-surgical reduction (air or barium enema) is the first-line treatment and has high success rates, but surgery may be required if non-surgical reduction fails or if there is concern about bowel viability.",14.591,57.164,65.087,4," The diagnosis of manganese toxicity is indeed a strong consideration in this case. The patient presents with progressive handwriting impairment, slurred speech, and other neurological symptoms such as reduced facial expression, blepharospasm, and dysarthria. His history of unprotected exposure to welding fumes provides further context, as manganese is a known neurotoxin commonly associated with occupational exposure in welding.",4.179,60.47,66.303,9,"Gastric Outlet Obstruction: The key feature is likely dilated gastric and proximal small bowel loops, which suggest a mechanical obstruction. In GI tuberculosis, this is often due to inflammatory or fibrotic strictures in the stomach or duodenum, leading to impaired gastric emptying. Thickened Gastric and Duodenal Walls: Tuberculous involvement of the gastrointestinal tract typically presents with wall thickening, often with a mottled or asymmetric appearance. This is due to granulomatous inflammation, which can lead to stricture formation and obstructive symptoms. Lymphadenopathy: Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are often seen in GI TB, particularly around the duodenum and jejunum. These nodes may be confluent and can cause additional compression or obstruction. Absence of Perforation or Free Air: GI TB typically does not present with perforation unless there is a superimposed infection or complication. Therefore, the absence of free air or peritoneal signs on CT would be expected in a straightforward case of gastric outlet obstruction from TB.",7.288,54.941,57.572,6,"The diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) in this patient is highly likely based on the provided details. Here's a structured breakdown supporting this conclusion:  Key Clinical Features: Symptoms: Confusion, blurry vision, and seizures are hallmark manifestations of PRES. History: Recent initiation of cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor, which is a known trigger for PRES due to endothelial dysfunction. Underlying IgA nephropathy, which may cause hypertension and renal dysfunction, further predisposing the patient to PRES. Physical Examination: Blood Pressure: Elevated (160/80 mm Hg), a common trigger for PRES, even if not dramatically hypertensive. Neurological Signs: Drowsiness and decreased visual acuity, aligning with the encephalopathy and posterior circulation involvement typical of PRES.",5.473,106.903,109.527,5," The diagnosis of Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS) is strongly supported based on the provided clinical information.   Key Supporting Features: Clinical Presentation:  A 1-month history of bloody dialysate is an unusual finding in peritoneal dialysis and is concerning for peritoneal membrane pathology, including EPS. History of Peritoneal Dialysis:  Long-term peritoneal dialysis is a significant risk factor for EPS, especially in patients with a history of recurrent bacterial peritonitis, as seen in this patient (3 episodes in 12 years). Imaging (CT of Abdomen):  Although imaging findings are not explicitly described here, characteristic features of EPS on CT include: Peritoneal thickening and calcifications. Encapsulation of bowel loops. Loculated fluid collections or adhesions. Unremarkable Physical Examination and Laboratory Studies:  EPS often presents as a chronic process, and its early stages may lack systemic inflammatory signs.",7.876,48.377,53.426,5,"The diagnosis of Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) of the Spinal Cord is well-supported by the provided clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings.    Clinical Presentation:  Progressive neurological symptoms: Tingling in arms and legs (paresthesias). Inability to walk due to sensory ataxia, a hallmark of SCD. Symptoms progressing over weeks suggest a subacute onset. Physical Examination:  Positive Romberg test: Indicates sensory ataxia due to impaired proprioception. Impaired proprioception and vibratory sensation: Results from dorsal column involvement. Preserved nociception (pain and temperature sensation): Suggests selective involvement of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts without spinothalamic tract damage. Imaging (MRI):  Hyperintensity in the posterior spinal cord from C1 to T12: Reflects demyelination of the dorsal columns. Hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging in the dorsal columns: Highly characteristic of SCD, often described as the ""inverted V sign.""",6.432,70.187,80.928,8,The diagnosis of pulmonary artery dissection (PAD) is strongly supported Clinical Presentation:  Acute chest pain in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and a pulmonary aneurysm raises high suspicion for a vascular catastrophe such as PAD. Medical History:  Idiopathic PAH: Chronic elevated pressures in the pulmonary circulation increase the risk of arterial wall stress and weakening. Pulmonary Aneurysm: Aneurysmal dilation further predisposes the pulmonary artery to dissection by increasing wall tension according to Laplace's law. Imaging (CT Chest):  Findings likely include: Pulmonary artery dilation (consistent with the aneurysm). Presence of a dissection flap or intramural hematoma within the pulmonary artery. Contrast extravasation or false lumen formation may confirm the dissection.,8.447,66.477,80.69,6," The diagnosis of rhinolith is well-supported by the clinical, physical examination, and imaging findings in this case.  Clinical Presentation:  Chronic nasal obstruction: Difficulty breathing through the right nostril is a common symptom caused by a long-standing intranasal mass. Chronicity of symptoms aligns with the slow-growing nature of rhinoliths. Physical Examination:  Nasal septal deviation and calcified septal spurs: These structural abnormalities might predispose to nasal airflow obstruction and retention of secretions, facilitating rhinolith formation. Posterior septal perforation: Could result from chronic irritation or pressure from the rhinolith or prior trauma/infection. Rhinoscopy Findings:  The hard, nontender, white mass in the floor of the right nostril is characteristic of a rhinolith. Rhinoliths are often discovered during endoscopic evaluations as they are asymptomatic early on. Imaging (CT of Paranasal Sinuses):  Well-defined, radiodense mass: This finding is pathognomonic for a rhinolith, representing calcification around a nidus (e.g., a foreign body or inspissated material).",4.902,66.188,109.595,10,"The most likely diagnosis is congenital infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) complicated by high-output cardiac failure and hypothyroidism.  Clinical Presentation:  Lethargy: Non-specific but significant in neonates, often indicating systemic or metabolic disturbances. Tachypnea: Suggestive of respiratory compensation for metabolic derangements or cardiac involvement. Physical Examination:  Marked hepatomegaly: Strongly suggests a space-occupying process in the liver, consistent with hepatic hemangiomas. Small skin hemangiomas: Skin hemangiomas are commonly associated with internal hemangiomas, particularly in the liver. Laboratory Findings:  Elevated TSH: Indicates hypothyroidism, which can result from the increased metabolism of thyroid hormones by large or multiple hemangiomas producing type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase. Imaging Findings:  Numerous hepatic lesions on MRI: Characteristic of IHH, which typically presents as hypervascular liver lesions. Cardiomegaly: Likely secondary to high-output cardiac failure, a known complication of large hepatic hemangiomas due to arteriovenous shunting.",3.099,218.048,221.883,9,"The likely diagnosis is brain metastases secondary to metastatic colon adenocarcinoma.   Clinical Presentation:  Altered mental status over 3 weeks suggests a progressive intracranial process. Neurological symptoms often result from mass effect, increased intracranial pressure, or local disruption of brain tissue. Medical History:  Colon adenocarcinoma with known metastases to the lung and bones indicates a systemic spread. The brain is a common metastatic site in advanced malignancies. Imaging Findings:  Multiple enhancing lesions on gadolinium-enhanced MRI are typical of metastatic brain tumors, particularly in the context of known systemic cancer. Metastatic Pattern and Pathophysiology:  Colon cancer primarily spreads to the liver and lungs but can also metastasize to the brain, particularly when other distant metastases (e.g., bone) are already present. Hematogenous spread through the bloodstream is the most common route for brain metastases. Symptoms Correlation:  Mental status changes align with brain lesions' effects on brain function and intracranial pressure.",36.68,112.766,119.575,6,"The most likely diagnosis is disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.  Clinical Presentation:  Symptoms of abdominal pain, night sweats, and systemic illness are classic for disseminated opportunistic infections in severely immunocompromised individuals. Immunological Status:  CD4 count of 18 cells/mm³ reflects severe immunosuppression, placing the patient at high risk for opportunistic infections, including disseminated MAC. Undetectable HIV viral load might indicate suppression with intermittent therapy adherence, but the low CD4 count signifies advanced immune dysfunction. Physical Examination:  Findings of massive splenomegaly and diffuse abdominal tenderness suggest significant systemic infection with organ involvement. Imaging Findings:  Massive splenomegaly with multifocal infarction is consistent with disseminated granulomatous diseases like MAC, which can cause vascular compromise and infarction in the spleen. Symptoms Correlation:  Night sweats and systemic symptoms like weight loss or fever are characteristic of MAC in immunosuppressed patients. Splenic infarction and distention further point to a granulomatous infectious etiology. Pathophysiology:  MAC often spreads hematogenously in severely immunosuppressed patients, involving the reticuloendothelial system (spleen, liver, lymph nodes) and causing granulomas, organomegaly, and systemic symptoms.",7.134,45.215,50.904,5,"The most likely diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis.  Supporting Evidence: Clinical Presentation:  Chronic symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, and fever over 3 months suggest systemic disease with respiratory involvement. Fever is consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process. Physical Examination:  Inflamed nasal mucosa and crusting indicate upper respiratory tract involvement, a hallmark of GPA. Wheezes and rales on auscultation suggest pulmonary disease, potentially from granulomatous inflammation or alveolar hemorrhage. Imaging Findings:  Extensive destruction of the midface structural bones with a large nasal cavity is characteristic of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, commonly seen in GPA. Pathophysiology:  GPA is a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis associated with necrotizing granulomas that often affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. Symptoms Correlation:  The involvement of both the upper respiratory tract (sinus destruction) and lower respiratory tract (pulmonary symptoms) is strongly suggestive of GPA.",8.615,42.154,108.715,2,"The most likely diagnosis is acute diverticulitis.   Clinical Presentation:  Abdominal pain that started in the periumbilical area and shifted to the left lower quadrant (LLQ) is classic for diverticulitis, as the sigmoid colon (commonly affected) is located in the LLQ. Laboratory Findings:  Elevated white-cell count (12,000/mm³) indicates an inflammatory or infectious process. Normal lactate level (1.8 mmol/L, below the threshold of 1.9 mmol/L) suggests no significant ischemia or sepsis. Imaging Findings:  CT findings of sigmoid colon edema and thumbprinting are characteristic of diverticulitis. Thumbprinting reflects mucosal/submucosal edema or inflammation, consistent with this diagnosis.",3.361,150.931,153.561,7,"The likely diagnosis is Wernicke encephalopathy.   Clinical Presentation:  A 28-year-old woman with vertigo, confusion, and falls 2 weeks after a surgical abortion suggests a possible post-surgical complication, with neurological signs indicating a central cause. Neurological Examination:  The presence of spontaneous upbeat nystagmus, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and gait ataxia are classic neurological findings associated with Wernicke encephalopathy, a disorder of the central nervous system. Pathophysiology:  Wernicke encephalopathy is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often precipitated by metabolic stress, such as surgery, malnutrition, or other conditions (e.g., hyperemesis gravidarum during pregnancy). These risk factors are present in this patient following a surgical abortion. MRI Findings:  The hyperintense lesions in the periaqueductal region and thalamus seen on MRI are characteristic of Wernicke encephalopathy. Symptoms Correlation:  The constellation of vertigo, confusion, nystagmus, and ataxia points to a thiamine deficiency-related encephalopathy, which specifically affects structures like the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum.The likely diagnosis is Wernicke encephalopathy.

Clinical Presentation:  Progressively worsening headaches are a common symptom of CAA due to the microbleeds that occur in the brain. Bluish nodular skin lesions could indicate systemic amyloidosis, where amyloid deposits can affect multiple organs, including the skin. Imaging Findings:  The MRI image showing multiple microbleeds is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which involves the deposition of amyloid-beta peptides in the walls of cerebral blood vessels, leading to increased fragility and microhemorrhages. Symptoms Correlation:  The combination of headaches (likely due to cerebral microbleeds) and skin lesions (suggesting amyloid deposits) aligns with CAA with potential systemic involvement.",6.293,40.239,47.728,10,"The most likely diagnosis is lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Clinical Presentation:  The acute chest pain and progressive dyspnea over several months are common symptoms of LAM, especially as the disease progresses and causes pulmonary complications such as pneumothorax. Physical Examination:  Oxygen saturation of 92% and diminished breath sounds on the right side are indicative of a pneumothorax (likely the cause of acute chest pain), a common complication of LAM due to the fragile, cystic nature of the lungs in this condition. Imaging Findings:  Chest CT revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax and diffuse, intraparenchymal pulmonary cysts, which are hallmark findings in LAM. The cysts result from the proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, leading to the formation of these cysts and subsequent lung structural damage.",5.146,25.03,65.013,5,"The most likely diagnosis is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).   Clinical Presentation:  The patient presents with rapid cognitive deterioration over the course of 3 weeks, which is typical of CJD. Neurologic findings such as disorientation, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, hyperreflexia, startle myoclonus, and ataxia are also common in prion diseases, particularly CJD. Imaging Findings:  The brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showing hyperintensity of the cortical gyri and caudate heads is a classic feature of CJD. These MRI findings represent spongiform changes in the brain, which are characteristic of prion diseases. Symptoms Correlation:  The combination of rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, and the MRI findings strongly suggests CJD, as these features are hallmark signs of the disease.",5.222,25.22,31.271,6,"The most likely diagnosis is hepatic echinococcosis (hydatid disease), caused by infection with the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient has a 15-month history of intermittent discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, which is a common symptom of hepatic echinococcosis due to cyst formation in the liver. Epidemiological History:  The patient’s residence in a rural area of Morocco and occasional contact with dogs are important risk factors. Dogs are definitive hosts for the Echinococcus tapeworm, and humans are incidental hosts, often becoming infected by ingesting eggs shed by infected dogs. Physical Examination:  Hepatomegaly with a palpable hepatic mass is consistent with a hydatid cyst in the liver. The cysts can grow to large sizes and cause symptoms like pain or discomfort. Laboratory Findings:  The normal white-cell count and normal absolute eosinophil count are common in hydatid disease, as eosinophilia is not always present, especially in the absence of acute infection or an allergic reaction. Imaging Findings:  Ultrasonography and CT imaging revealing a large cyst in the right lobe of the liver is characteristic of hydatid cysts. Hydatid cysts are typically well-defined, fluid-filled structures with a multi-layered appearance (laminated membrane) visible on imaging, which helps differentiate them from other liver cysts.",2.851,31.518,49.103,7,"The most likely diagnosis is metastatic ocular melanoma.   Clinical Presentation:  The patient has a 4-day history of inflammation and pain in the right eye, where she had been blind for several years. The fact that the patient has been blind for a prolonged period suggests a prior ocular condition, and the acute symptoms in the right eye could indicate a secondary complication, such as metastasis. Imaging Findings:  MRI of the orbit revealed a right orbital mass, which is indicative of a significant lesion, possibly metastasis from a primary ocular melanoma. Abdominal and thoracic imaging showed numerous hepatic masses, abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease, all signs of widespread metastatic disease, which is characteristic of melanoma's tendency to spread to multiple organs, particularly the liver, lymph nodes, and bones. Systemic Involvement:  The involvement of multiple organ systems, including the liver, lymph nodes, and bones, is highly suggestive of a metastatic process, and melanoma, particularly ocular melanoma, is known to have a high propensity to metastasize to these areas.",6.615,37.951,133.648,5,"The most likely diagnosis is neurocysticercosis.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and confusion, both of which are common neurological manifestations of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Physical Examination:  Swelling over the right eye and tenderness in the right testis suggest systemic involvement, which is consistent with disseminated cysticercosis. Cysticercosis can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain (neurocysticercosis), muscles, and eyes, and can present with palpable cysts or swelling in these areas. Imaging Findings:  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed numerous well-defined cystic lesions throughout the cerebral cortex, which are characteristic of neurocysticercosis. The cysts are typically located in the subarachnoid space, ventricles, or brain parenchyma and may cause seizures due to inflammation or compression of neural structures.",11.773,69.115,174.157,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,6,Highlighted any major clinical findings would be my first and foremost suggestion.,3,,2,,1.6,1.6,6.16,1,15,1.345,1.345,3.757,1,5,2,9,5,2.276,23.312,41.843,5,75,75,6,3,5,3.254,16.054,25.013,3,4,1,4,2,2,4.382,54.469,65.852,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,10.1,255.433,268.896,7,7,6,7,7,6,6,36.06,61.062,67.645,6,,,,,,,,,,,2,,790CA6F0-5D06-4689-AD71-EA4F4B6BD7AE,21,,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65272,66694,57828,109731,53629,81459,80885,109790,222102,119889,51272,108915,153799,111951,48239,65214,31489,49313,133866,174388,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3
